# 🚀 Learning Go - Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my Go learning journey! This repository contains various mini projects and experiments I'm building while learning the Go programming language.

## 📚 About This Repository

I'm documenting my Go learning process by creating small, focused projects that explore different aspects of the language. Each project helps me understand Go's concepts, syntax, and best practices.

## 🛠️ Projects

### 🎮 Basic Projects

- **`basic/`** - Rock Paper Scissors game with user input and random computer choices
- **`asyncgo/`** - Exploring goroutines, channels, and file processing for duplicate line detection
- **`fetch/`** - HTTP client that fetches web pages and saves them locally

### 🌐 Web & Networking

- **`rtm/`** - Real-time messaging server using Server-Sent Events (SSE) with reconnection support
- **`js/`** - Frontend experiments with debounced search functionality

### 🎨 Graphics & Processing

- **`ascee/`** - ASCII art generator from images with edge detection capabilities
- **`gif/`** - GIF processing experiments

### ⚡ Advanced Concepts

- **`task-manager/`** - Task management application exploring Go's concurrency patterns

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- **Concurrency**: Goroutines, channels, and concurrent programming patterns
- **Web Development**: HTTP servers, SSE, real-time communication
- **File I/O**: Reading, writing, and processing various file formats
- **Image Processing**: Working with JPEG/PNG images and creating ASCII art
- **Error Handling**: Go's idiomatic error handling patterns
- **Standard Library**: Exploring Go's rich standard library

## 🔧 How to Run

Most projects can be run using:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
go run main.go
```

Some projects may require additional setup or command-line arguments - check individual project directories for specific instructions.

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- ✅ Basic syntax and control structures
- ✅ Functions and error handling
- ✅ Goroutines and channels
- ✅ HTTP client/server programming
- ✅ File I/O and image processing
- 🔄 Advanced concurrency patterns
- 🔄 Testing and benchmarking
- ⏳ Database integration
- ⏳ REST API development

## 🤝 Learning Resources

- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

## 📝 Notes

This repository serves as my personal learning playground. Code may not always follow production best practices as I'm experimenting and learning. Each project builds upon previous concepts and introduces new ones.

Feel free to explore the code and see my progression through the Go language! 🎉
